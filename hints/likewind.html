    <div class="answer">
        You need to break the input text into single words and calculate the number of each word (that we are looking for 
        according to the given data) in the resulted list of words. Then you need to create a dictionary and add the information to it.

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        OK, let's start from the beginning.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        First of all, you need to break the input text into single words. For this you can use the 
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split'>str.split() method</a>.
    </div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        How will it look like in code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        At this stage, the function will be as follows:
         <pre class="brush: python">
def popular_words(text: str, words: list) -> dict:
    splitted_words = text.split()</pre>
       In practice, this method will work in the following way: 'I am alive'.split() --> ['I', 'am', 'alive']
    </div>
</div>    

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        How to count in the resulting list the number of words that we are looking for and add this information to the dictionary?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        To count the number of each word from the input 'words' list, you must use
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements'>'for' loop</a>. You can read more about 
        the calculation with the 'count' method in the following catalogue of 
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists'>methods of working with lists</a>.
    </div>
</div>    

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        How to implement these methods in code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The updated function will look like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def popular_words(text: str, words: list) -> dict:
    splitted_words = text.split()
    answer = {}
    for word in words:
        answer[word] = splitted_words.count(word)
    return answer</pre>
        This will create the answer keys inside the dictionary with words from the 'words' list, and assign them values that will show 
        how many times each word is found in the input text broken into single words (splitted_words).
    </div>
</div>    
    
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        What to do if "one" and "One" are considered to be different words?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need to replace all of the uppercase letters in the input text with the lowercase letters.
        In this situation will help the
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower'>str.lower() method</a>.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        How will the whole function look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        After adding the corresponding string, code will look like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def popular_words(text: str, words: list) -> dict:
    text = text.lower()
    splitted_words = text.split()
    answer = {}
    for word in words:
        answer[word] = splitted_words.count(word)
    return answer</pre>
        Note that you must first convert all of the uppercase letters to the lowercase letters in the text,
        and then break it into the single words.
