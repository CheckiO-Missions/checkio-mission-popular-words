        You need to create a dictionary, then calculate the number of each word in the input text (those that 
        we are looking for according to the given data) and add this information to the created dictionary.

        I don't know how to count the words and add this information to the dictionary.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        If we want to count the number of words 'one' then we need to type:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def popular_words(text, words):
    answer = {}
    answer['one'] = text.count('one')
    return answer</pre>
        This will create a "one" answer key inside the dictionary and assign to it a value that shows how many times
        the word 'one' appears in the input text.
    </div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        But we need to count not only the number of the word 'one'. What should I do with the rest of the words?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        To search for other words from the given list use
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements'>'for' loop</a>.

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Could you show exactly how to do this?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The code written earlier we are changing in the following way:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def popular_words(text, words):
    answer = {}
    for word in words:
        answer[word] = text.count(word)
    return answer</pre>
        In this case, all the words that we need to count according to the given 'words' list will be added as keys to the output 'answer' dictionary, 
        as well as the number of these words will be added as the keys values to the 'text'.
    </div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        What should I do if the answer still turns out to be wrong?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Most likely you didn't consider that the input text contains both the uppercase and lowercase letters.
        In order for the function to return the correct result - you need to convert all of the uppercase letters in the input text 
        to the lowercase letters.
        The
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower'>str.lower() method</a> will help the situation.

        I still need to see the full version of the code, otherwise I can't figure it out...
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The answer looks like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def popular_words(text, words):
    text = text.lower()
    answer = {}
    for word in words:
        answer[word] = text.count(word)
    return answer</pre>
    </div>
